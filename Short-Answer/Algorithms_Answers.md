#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

> **O(n)**

> At first glance, the thought is `O(n*n*n)`, but evaluation of the operation in the loop changes things. The operation adds `n*n` to an accumulator (a) every iteration. because `n*n` is part of the iteration evaluation of `n*n*n`, we can factor that portion out to a constant `1`. O(1\*n) == O(n)

b)

c)
